# Reflection on Using AI Agents

I used ChatGPT heavily to complete this assignment quickly while still following a proper hexagonal architecture. This was my first time implementing CB (Compliance Balance), banking, and pooling rules in a full-stack setup.

## What I Learned

- How to organize backend into core/application/ports with adapters
- How FuelEU rules translate into code (CB, banking, pooling logic)
- Building a React + TypeScript + Tailwind dashboard connected to backend APIs

## How AI Improved Efficiency

- Generated boilerplate code and folder structure
- Helped convert the FuelEU formulas into TypeScript
- Saved time building UI components for the four dashboard tabs
- Assisted in writing documentation

Without AI, this would take much longer to complete.

## Where I Still Had to Debug

- TailwindCSS configuration: switched to Tailwind v3 after errors
- TypeScript config issues with imports
- Some incorrect imports and missing files fixed manually

## Improvements for the Future

- Add real PostgreSQL adapter instead of in-memory data
- Write tests for API endpoints and domain logic
- Improve UI styling and validation

Overall, AI helped me finish a working full-stack assignment in a short deadline while learning a clean architecture approach.
